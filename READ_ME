                                                              React-Router-ModalPage...
This is a React-Router modalpage using ReactHooks & Router.I fetched the data's from given fake API.
First i cretae three components for this project, insideof src folder.
1) src => components =>Navbar.jsx
2) src => components = > Products.jsx
3) src => components => cartpage.jsx
This is shopping application. You can add your cartlist which product you like, you can remove that same product in your catlist and also you can increase the quantity 
of the product ii'll finally dispaly the amount with 10% discount.
I create this page using html, css, javascriptcode in jsx files with the help of React-Router.
First i'm going to shown our shop (King & Queen Shop ) Product's  and how we fetched data from fake API.
In Navbar i shown mt shop name and our cartbutton.
Secondi use API in products component.  In useState i put a empty array for [ products, setProducts ]. in useeffect also i put Empty array for avoiding rerendering the page.
  From that link i got a productid, image, title and price of that product. And below of this i create a button AddToCart.
when we click that button that product will add to our cartlist and that same time the button will the change it's state to Remove from cart. 
This buttons working based on the operation what we written in app.jsx. In this file i wriiten the arrow function and return the results in if else conditions.
Now this is a Cartpage component. Our cartpage component want's to shown the cartlist and it's also given the product details.
When we click the you cart cutton it will shown our cartlist and the path also change because of using Routes.
This is child component of App component. So, I Written the code in App.jsxfor carItems, closeCart, removefromCart, increase and decreese buttons.
I get that from using props{}. 
Cartitem have details about product for this i use setCartitems.
when we go to our cartlist we can incraese the product count using (+) and decreece (-). Whwn it is + the price will also increase and dicreace.
Finally the amount will shown the 10% discount. price function is writte in this same page because we need to shown a new page.
If we need to show the new page in react we written that code in same page don't use the props here. And put  a Route for this navigation.
In Navbar we take a length from cartItems for that count and call the openCart function here. In jsx calling  the function we use {}.
  Finally we create a Amazing shooping page!.....
